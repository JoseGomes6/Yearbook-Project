# Yearbook Project

# Introduction

This project is a modern, responsive web application designed to serve as a digital yearbook for a graduating class. It allows users (students) to create, customize, and view their individual yearbook profiles, including personal information, academic achievements, and a favorite quote. The application is built using React for a dynamic user experience and styled with clean, modern CSS.
